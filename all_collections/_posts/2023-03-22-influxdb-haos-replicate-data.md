As the world becomes increasingly connected through IoT, the need for reliable data storage and transfer has become crucial. Raspberry Pi has been a popular choice as an IoT gateway, however, ensuring data retention without internet connectivity is challenging. In this article, we'll explore how using InfluxDB replication feature can help retain data on Raspberry Pi even in the absence of internet connectivity. We'll also discuss how Home Assistant can be used to scrape data from a UPnP router service to store locally in InfluxDB instance. By leveraging these tools, you can ensure your IoT devices remain online, collecting and storing critical data no matter what.

## What is Home Assistant and influxDb ???

Home Assistant is an open-source home automation platform that allows users to connect and control a wide range of smart devices from various manufacturers. It enables users to set up automated routines, control their devices through voice assistants like Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, and access the platform via a web interface or mobile app. Home Assistant also offers advanced features such as data scraping, machine learning, and custom integrations with third-party services. Overall, it is a powerful tool that allows users to create a personalized and integrated smart home experience.

InfluxDB is a popular open-source time-series database designed for storing and querying large amounts of timestamped data such as metrics, events, and IoT sensor data. It has a powerful query language that allows users to aggregate and manipulate data in real-time. InfluxDB is often used in IoT systems where there is a need to store and analyze high volume, continuous streams of data over time. Additionally, it supports features like retention policies, which let you define how long data should be kept, and continuous queries, which provide insights into real-time trends and predictions. Overall, InfluxDB is a scalable and reliable choice for those dealing with time-series data.
